10,1077,53,Dress looks like it's made of cheap material,Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,3,14,General,Dresses,Dresses

my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.

24,847,55,Versatile,"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!",5,0,General,Tops,Blouses
26,949,33,Huge disappointment,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,2,0,General,Tops,Sweaters

(the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun",5,34,General,Tops,Knits

23415,1020,39,"Beautiful, unique piece","Love it! i am 125# and usually a size 2-4 or 26-27 in bottoms. typically size up for holding horses. based on other reviews, i ordered this in a 2. it stretched just a bit after wearing all day, so i'm glad i didn't get my normal 4. the fit is great, quality is great. it dresses up for a casual office day, wearing well with boots and tights, and i imagine pairing with tshirt and flip flops over the summer. i unique piece that quickly became a favorite.",5,0,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
23416,1110,40,Great swing dress ... but not for me,"On the hanger, this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me, not quite. 

the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle ... and the shorter length accentuated my big calves. 

for reference, i tried a 00p and i'm 5'1"", 102#, and 34a.",4,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23421,850,39,Perfect tunic!!,"Love, love this tunic. my size 4 fits perfectly with a little room, material is very soft and very comfortable. could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dress...so many options. so worth it!!!",5,3,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
23423,854,41,Another great tiny top.,"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",5,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23428,926,67,Beautiful !!!,"I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true",5,0,General,Tops,Sweaters
23432,1104,53,Okay,"Overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn't love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down.",4,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23441,1104,63,Sweet surprise,"Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett",5,25,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23443,862,62,Practical and pretty,"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",5,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits

23448,1104,39,Soft and warm,"I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)",5,7,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23452,999,38,Full skirt,"I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller.",3,1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
23455,1104,35,Cute dress,"This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.",4,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23457,262,49,Adorable,"These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!",5,3,General Petite,Intimate,Lounge
23462,999,24,Its okay,The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.,3,0,General,Bottoms,Skirts
23463,262,65,Comfy pants,"These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.",4,1,General Petite,Intimate,Lounge
23465,1078,41,Falls nicely,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.,5,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
23479,1005,42,What a fun piece!,"So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the",5,0,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
23482,862,48,Wish it was made of cotton,"It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft, stretchy, shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves.
not for me but maybe for others. just ok.",3,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
